# Instructions for Claude Code Sessions

## Verify Launch Directory

**CRITICAL: Check this FIRST on every session:**

```bash
# Verify we're in the community-patterns repository root
git remote get-url origin 2>/dev/null | grep -q "community-patterns"
```

**If this fails:**
- User launched Claude from the WRONG directory
- **STOP IMMEDIATELY and tell the user:**
  - "Please quit Claude and relaunch it from your community-patterns directory"
  - "You can find it wherever you cloned it (e.g., `cd ~/Code/community-patterns` or `cd ~/Code/common-tools/community-patterns`)"
  - "Then run `claude` from there"

**If this succeeds:**
- Continue with setup checks below

---

## First-Time Setup Check

**Check if this is first-time setup:**

```bash
# Quick check: Does workspace config exist?
test -f .claude-workspace && echo "Setup complete" || echo "First-time setup needed"
```

**If "First-time setup needed":**
- This is **FIRST-TIME SETUP**
- **STOP HERE and run GETTING_STARTED.md**
- Follow that guide step-by-step to set up:
  - labs repository
  - .env file with API keys
  - upstream remote
  - user's workspace
  - identity key (claude.key at repo root)
  - workspace config file (.claude-workspace)
  - first pattern

**If "Setup complete":**
- User is already set up
- Load workspace config (see Step 2)
- Continue with Session Startup Sequence below

---

## Session Startup Sequence

**Follow these steps IN ORDER on every session:**

### Step 1: Check for Upstream Updates

**Always check for updates from upstream first:**

```bash
# Check if updates are available
git fetch upstream 2>/dev/null || echo "No upstream configured"
git status

# If behind upstream/main, pull updates
# Example output: "Your branch is behind 'upstream/main' by 3 commits"
```

**If updates available:**
```bash
# Pull updates (will update CLAUDE.md, GETTING_STARTED.md, examples, etc.)
git pull --rebase upstream main

# If rebase succeeds
git push origin main

# If conflicts (rare - user files are in their namespace)
# Show conflicts and help resolve
```

**Why this matters:**
- Gets latest CLAUDE.md (this file!) with new instructions
- Gets updated GETTING_STARTED.md and DEVELOPMENT.md
- Gets new example patterns
- Gets other users' contributed patterns

### Step 1.5: Update Labs and Recipes Repositories

**After updating community-patterns, also update labs/ and recipes/ (if they exist):**

```bash
# Get parent directory
PARENT_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/.."

# Update labs (required)
if [ -d "$PARENT_DIR/labs" ]; then
  echo "Updating labs repository..."
  cd "$PARENT_DIR/labs"
  git fetch origin
  git pull --rebase origin main
  cd -
else
  echo "⚠️  labs/ not found - user may need to clone it"
fi

# Update recipes (optional)
if [ -d "$PARENT_DIR/recipes" ]; then
  echo "Updating recipes repository..."
  cd "$PARENT_DIR/recipes"
  git fetch origin
  git pull --rebase origin main
  cd -
fi
```

**Tell user:**
```
Updated dependency repositories (labs and recipes if available).
[If found updates]: Pulled latest updates! This includes:
  - Updated documentation
  - New example patterns
  - [list what changed if significant]

[If no updates]: Already up to date with upstream.
```

### Step 1.5: Check Reference Repositories (Weekly)

**If it's been a while since last check, check for reference repo updates:**

```bash
# Check if labs or recipes need updating
cd ~/Code/labs && git fetch origin && git status
cd ~/Code/recipes && git fetch origin && git status 2>/dev/null
```

**If updates available, update automatically:**

```bash
# Stop both dev servers if running (will handle gracefully if not running)
pkill -f "packages/toolshed.*deno task dev"
pkill -f "packages/shell.*deno task dev-local"

# Pull updates
cd ~/Code/labs && git pull origin main

# Restart both servers in background
cd ~/Code/labs/packages/toolshed && deno task dev > /tmp/toolshed-dev.log 2>&1 &
cd ~/Code/labs/packages/shell && deno task dev-local > /tmp/shell-dev.log 2>&1 &

# Give them a moment to start
sleep 3

echo "Both dev servers restarted with latest labs updates"
echo "Toolshed (backend): http://localhost:8000"
echo "Shell (frontend): http://localhost:5173"
```

**Important Notes:**
- **labs/** updates may include new framework features, bug fixes, or documentation
- **Dev server must be restarted** after pulling labs updates
- **recipes/** (if cloned) contains example patterns - optional to update
- Check approximately weekly, or when user encounters framework issues

### Step 2: Load Workspace Configuration

**Why we need this:** Your GitHub username is used for:
- Determining which `patterns/$GITHUB_USER/` directory is yours
- Committing patterns with proper attribution
- Deploying patterns with your identity key
- Keeping your work isolated from other users

**Load cached configuration:**

```bash
# Read workspace config (created during first-time setup)
if [ -f .claude-workspace ]; then
  GITHUB_USER=$(grep "^username=" .claude-workspace | cut -d= -f2)
  IS_FORK=$(grep "^is_fork=" .claude-workspace | cut -d= -f2)
  echo "Loaded workspace: patterns/$GITHUB_USER/"
  echo "Repository type: $([ "$IS_FORK" = "true" ] && echo "fork" || echo "upstream")"
else
  echo "ERROR: .claude-workspace not found - run GETTING_STARTED.md first"
  exit 1
fi
```

**If .claude-workspace doesn't exist** (shouldn't happen after setup):
```bash
# Detect from origin remote URL (most reliable)
ORIGIN_URL=$(git remote get-url origin)
GITHUB_USER=$(echo "$ORIGIN_URL" | sed -E 's/.*[:/]([^/]+)\/community-patterns.*/\1/')

# Detect if this is a fork (has upstream remote)
if git remote get-url upstream >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  IS_FORK=true
else
  IS_FORK=false
fi

# Create workspace config file
cat > .claude-workspace << EOF
username=$GITHUB_USER
is_fork=$IS_FORK
setup_complete=true
EOF

echo "Created .claude-workspace for: $GITHUB_USER"
echo "Repository type: $([ "$IS_FORK" = "true" ] && echo "fork" || echo "upstream")"
```

**Confirm with user:**
```
Ready to work! Your workspace: patterns/$GITHUB_USER/

What would you like to work on today?
```

**About `is_fork` configuration:**
- **Fork** (`is_fork=true`): User has their own fork with `upstream` remote pointing to jkomoros/community-patterns
  - PRs go from their fork to upstream
  - Fetch/rebase from `upstream/main` before creating PRs
  - Most common scenario for contributors
- **Direct** (`is_fork=false`): User working directly on jkomoros/community-patterns (e.g., jkomoros or collaborators)
  - PRs go from feature branch to main in same repo
  - Fetch/rebase from `origin/main` before creating PRs
  - Less common, requires write access to upstream
- This value is cached to avoid repeatedly checking `git remote` - it won't change during development

### Step 3: Check and Start Dev Servers (If Needed)

**IMPORTANT: Two servers must be running:**
1. **Toolshed** (backend) - Port 8000
2. **Shell** (frontend) - Port 5173

**First, check if servers are already running:**

```bash
# Check both ports
TOOLSHED_RUNNING=$(lsof -ti:8000 > /dev/null 2>&1 && echo "yes" || echo "no")
SHELL_RUNNING=$(lsof -ti:5173 > /dev/null 2>&1 && echo "yes" || echo "no")

if [ "$TOOLSHED_RUNNING" = "yes" ] && [ "$SHELL_RUNNING" = "yes" ]; then
  echo "✓ Both dev servers already running:"
  echo "  - Toolshed (backend): http://localhost:8000"
  echo "  - Shell (frontend): http://localhost:5173"
  echo ""
  echo "Servers are ready. No need to start them."
elif [ "$TOOLSHED_RUNNING" = "yes" ]; then
  echo "✓ Toolshed already running on port 8000"
  echo "✗ Shell not running - will start it"
  NEED_SHELL=1
elif [ "$SHELL_RUNNING" = "yes" ]; then
  echo "✓ Shell already running on port 5173"
  echo "✗ Toolshed not running - will start it"
  NEED_TOOLSHED=1
else
  echo "✗ No dev servers running - will start both"
  NEED_TOOLSHED=1
  NEED_SHELL=1
fi
```

**If servers are already running, STOP HERE and skip the rest of this step.**

**Tell the user:** "I can see your dev servers are already running. Skipping server startup."

**Only if servers need to be started, run this:**

```bash
# Start toolshed if needed
if [ "$NEED_TOOLSHED" = "1" ]; then
  cd ~/Code/labs/packages/toolshed && deno task dev > /tmp/toolshed-dev.log 2>&1 &
  echo "Started toolshed server (logs: /tmp/toolshed-dev.log)"
fi

# Start shell if needed
if [ "$NEED_SHELL" = "1" ]; then
  cd ~/Code/labs/packages/shell && deno task dev-local > /tmp/shell-dev.log 2>&1 &
  echo "Started shell server (logs: /tmp/shell-dev.log)"
fi

# Give servers a moment to start
if [ "$NEED_TOOLSHED" = "1" ] || [ "$NEED_SHELL" = "1" ]; then
  sleep 3
  echo "Dev servers started. Access at http://localhost:8000"
fi
```

**Why this matters:**
- Patterns need both servers to deploy and test
- The user may have started servers themselves - respect that and don't restart unnecessarily
- Toolshed handles pattern deployment and data
- Shell provides the UI for viewing patterns
- Claude only starts servers if they're not already running

### User Workspace Structure

**Recommended organization within `patterns/$GITHUB_USER/`:**

**WIP/** - Work in progress
- **IMPORTANT: Most pattern development should happen in WIP/**
- Patterns actively being developed
- Experimental features
- Not fully tested
- Can be messy/incomplete
- Keep working here until pattern is stable and tested

**lib/** - Copied reference patterns
- **CRITICAL**: NO MODIFICATIONS to files in lib/
- Copy patterns from labs or examples here for reference
- If you want to modify them, copy to WIP/ or root
- Helps differentiate your work from upstream patterns

**Root level** - Stable patterns
- Only move patterns here when fully tested and working
- Completed, tested patterns
- Ready for use or sharing
- Well-documented

**Example structure:**
```
patterns/alice/
├── README.md
├── WIP/
│   ├── experimental-ai-chat.tsx
│   └── testing-new-feature.tsx
├── lib/
│   ├── counter.tsx              # Copied from examples (unchanged)
│   └── shopping-list.tsx        # Copied from labs (unchanged)
├── my-todo-list.tsx             # Alice's stable pattern
└── my-notes-app.tsx             # Alice's stable pattern
```

## Core Principles

### DO

✅ **Always update from upstream first** (Step 1 above)
✅ **Work only in `patterns/$GITHUB_USER/`** - user's namespace
✅ **Commit frequently** with clear messages
✅ **Test patterns** before committing
✅ **Reference example patterns** for learning
✅ **Ask user** before structural changes

### DON'T

❌ **Never skip upstream update check** on session startup
❌ **Never modify other users' patterns** (`patterns/alice/`, etc.)
❌ **Never modify example patterns** (`patterns/examples/`)
❌ **Never modify root docs** (CLAUDE.md, etc.) unless user explicitly asks
❌ **Never commit identity keys** (claude.key, .claude-workspace - both gitignored)
❌ **Never work outside user's namespace** without permission

### Working with labs Repository

❌ **NEVER commit or push to labs** - it's READ-ONLY
✅ **If you accidentally changed something**: `git restore .`
✅ **To update labs**: Pull updates and restart dev server automatically

### Managing the Dev Servers

**You can restart both dev servers whenever needed:**

```bash
# Stop both servers
pkill -f "packages/toolshed.*deno task dev"
pkill -f "packages/shell.*deno task dev-local"

# Start both servers
cd ~/Code/labs/packages/toolshed && deno task dev > /tmp/toolshed-dev.log 2>&1 &
cd ~/Code/labs/packages/shell && deno task dev-local > /tmp/shell-dev.log 2>&1 &
sleep 3

echo "Both servers restarted"
```

**When to restart:**
- After pulling labs updates
- If patterns aren't deploying correctly
- If you see connection errors to localhost:8000 or localhost:5173
- User reports something not working

**Both servers run in background** - session can continue while they start

**Check server logs if issues occur:**
- Toolshed: `/tmp/toolshed-dev.log`
- Shell: `/tmp/shell-dev.log`

---

## Development Best Practices

### Always Use `deno task ct`, Never `ct` Directly

**CRITICAL: Always use `deno task ct` for all ct commands:**

```bash
# ✅ CORRECT
cd ~/Code/labs
deno task ct dev ../community-patterns/patterns/$GITHUB_USER/pattern.tsx --no-run

# ❌ WRONG - Don't use ct directly
ct dev ../community-patterns/patterns/$GITHUB_USER/pattern.tsx --no-run
```

**Why this matters:**
- Ensures consistent version across environments
- Avoids path resolution issues
- Matches framework expectations

### Use pattern-dev Skill for Reference

When learning patterns or stuck on implementation:

```
"Use the pattern-dev skill to refresh your understanding of framework patterns"
```

The pattern-dev skill reads all latest pattern documentation from the labs repo.

**When to use:**
- Starting a new pattern
- Confused about framework features
- Need examples of best practices
- Encountering framework-related issues

### Deleting Space Databases - DANGEROUS

**⚠️ ONLY delete with explicit user confirmation**

Location: `~/Code/labs/packages/toolshed/cache/memory/*.sqlite`

**WARNING: Deleting these files wipes out ALL local spaces permanently**
- All charms, data, and work in all spaces will be lost
- This affects all test spaces across all sessions

**When this might be needed:**
- Fixing corrupted spaces
- Testing fresh installs
- Clearing test data completely
- User explicitly says "delete all my spaces"

**Command:**
```bash
rm -rf ~/Code/labs/packages/toolshed/cache/memory/*.sqlite
```

**NEVER do this without explicit user permission**

### Space Naming Conventions

When testing patterns with Playwright, use temporary test spaces:

**Format:** `test-<username>-<counter>` or `debug-<username>-<counter>`

**Examples:**
```
test-alice-1
test-alice-2
debug-bob-1
experiment-charlie-1
```

**Important:**
- Increment counter for each new test space during session
- These are throwaway spaces for testing
- Use descriptive prefixes (test, debug, experiment, etc.)
- Include your username to identify your test spaces

### Communication Guidelines

**Don't:**
- Continuously summarize the entire session (user already knows what happened)
- Congratulate yourself for progress or use celebratory language
- Stop working just because you hit a problem (persist through issues)

**Do:**
- Report specific results when tasks complete
- Keep moving forward through challenges
- Focus on the current task, not past accomplishments

### Incremental Development & Commits

**Commit frequently as you make progress:**

- Make small, frequent commits as you accumulate verified working pieces
- **Verified means tested and working** (ideally with Playwright if available)
- Clearly label commits: "Add basic counter functionality"
- Slice work into small chunks that can be continuously extended
- Check in working pieces incrementally rather than waiting for complete features
- Each commit should represent a working increment

**Example commit flow:**
```bash
# After getting basic pattern working
git add patterns/$GITHUB_USER/WIP/my-pattern.tsx
git commit -m "Add basic counter pattern structure"

# After adding features
git commit -m "Add increment/decrement buttons"

# After testing
git commit -m "Test counter pattern in browser"
```

### Recovery Strategies

When encountering difficulties, follow this escalation path:

1. **Minor Confusion**: Reset back to your last commit, reflect on what you learned, and try another approach with that knowledge
2. **Moderate Confusion**: Look at other patterns in these directories for reference:
   - `patterns/examples/`
   - Other users' patterns in `patterns/*/`
   - Labs patterns (if you have recipes repo cloned)

### Snapshot Capability

When asked to "snapshot yourself", create a `SNAPSHOT.md` file containing:
- Current learnings and insights gained during the work
- Current work in progress and next steps
- Context needed for resuming work later
- **Important**: Add a note at the top: "DELETE THIS FILE AFTER READING"

**Example:**
```markdown
# DELETE THIS FILE AFTER READING

## Current Work
Working on photo gallery pattern in WIP/photo-gallery.tsx

## Learnings
- generateObject works well for image analysis
- Need to batch API calls to avoid rate limits
- Cell arrays require .equals() for reactivity

## Next Steps
- Add pagination for large photo sets
- Test with 50+ photos
- Add loading states
```

## Key Paths

| Purpose | Path |
|---------|------|
| Workspace config | `.claude-workspace` |
| Identity key | `claude.key` |
| User's workspace | `patterns/$GITHUB_USER/` |
| Example patterns | `patterns/examples/` |
| Development guide | `DEVELOPMENT.md` |
| Setup guide | `GETTING_STARTED.md` |
| Labs framework | `~/Code/labs/` |
| Labs docs | `~/Code/labs/docs/common/` |

---

## Pattern Development Commands

**IMPORTANT:** Always use `deno task ct`, never just `ct` directly.

### Test Syntax

```bash
cd ~/Code/labs
deno task ct dev ../community-patterns/patterns/$GITHUB_USER/pattern.tsx --no-run
```

### Deploy Pattern

```bash
cd ~/Code/labs
deno task ct charm new \
  --api-url http://localhost:8000 \
  --identity ../community-patterns/claude.key \
  --space my-space \
  ../community-patterns/patterns/$GITHUB_USER/pattern.tsx
```

### Update Deployed Pattern

```bash
cd ~/Code/labs
deno task ct charm setsrc \
  --api-url http://localhost:8000 \
  --identity ../community-patterns/claude.key \
  --space my-space \
  --charm CHARM-ID \
  ../community-patterns/patterns/$GITHUB_USER/pattern.tsx
```

**IMPORTANT**: Always use `deno task ct`, never just `ct` directly.

---

## Testing Patterns with Playwright

If Playwright MCP is available, use it to test patterns in a real browser.

### Navigate to Deployed Pattern

```
Use Playwright to navigate to: http://localhost:8000/my-space/CHARM-ID
```

### Test Pattern Functionality

Once the page loads:
1. Take a snapshot to see the UI: `browser_snapshot`
2. Interact with elements: click buttons, fill inputs, check boxes
3. Verify behavior: check that counters increment, items are added, etc.
4. Report any issues found

### Registering (First Time Only)

If you see a login/registration page:
1. Click "Register" or "Generate Passphrase"
2. Follow the registration flow
3. Then navigate back to the pattern URL

### Testing Workflow

**After deploying a new pattern:**
```
1. Deploy with ct charm new
2. Note the charm ID
3. Use Playwright to test at http://localhost:8000/space/charm-id
4. Verify all functionality works
5. Report to user if tests pass or if issues found
```

**After updating a pattern:**
```
1. Update with ct charm setsrc
2. Use Playwright to verify changes
3. Test that fixes work and nothing broke
```

**When Playwright unavailable:**
- Suggest user test manually in browser
- Provide the URL to test
- Ask them to report any issues

### Playwright Troubleshooting

**If Playwright starts opening many tabs:**

This can happen after user suspends/resumes their computer. The Chrome connection gets confused.

**Solution:** Ask user to:
1. Quit the Chrome instance that Playwright opened (the one with "Chrome is being controlled by automated test software" banner)
2. Next Playwright command will open a fresh browser and work normally

**Tell user:**
```
Playwright's browser connection got confused after your computer woke up.
Please quit the Chrome window with the yellow "automated test software" banner,
then I'll try again with a fresh browser.
```

---

## Git Workflow

### Committing Work

```bash
cd ~/Code/community-patterns

git add patterns/$GITHUB_USER/pattern.tsx
git commit -m "Add pattern: description"
git push origin main
```

### Getting Updates (Already done in Step 1)

```bash
git fetch upstream
git pull --rebase upstream main
git push origin main
```

### Sharing Work Upstream (Creating Pull Requests)

**IMPORTANT: Wait for user to tell you to create a PR.** Don't push or create PRs automatically.

**Before creating any PR, you MUST update from main and rebase your branch:**

#### Step 0: Update and Rebase Before Creating PR

**Use cached repository type from workspace config:**

```bash
# Read IS_FORK from .claude-workspace (set during Step 2)
IS_FORK=$(grep "^is_fork=" .claude-workspace | cut -d= -f2)

# Determine which remote to use
if [ "$IS_FORK" = "true" ]; then
  echo "Working on fork - will fetch from upstream"
  MAIN_REMOTE="upstream"
else
  echo "Working on main repo - will fetch from origin"
  MAIN_REMOTE="origin"
fi
```

**Then fetch latest main and rebase your branch:**

```bash
# Fetch latest main
git fetch $MAIN_REMOTE

# Rebase current branch on top of main
git rebase $MAIN_REMOTE/main

# If rebase succeeds, push (force-with-lease if on feature branch)
if [ "$(git branch --show-current)" != "main" ]; then
  git push origin $(git branch --show-current) --force-with-lease
else
  git push origin main
fi
```

**If rebase has conflicts:**
1. Show conflict files: `git status`
2. Help resolve conflicts
3. Continue: `git rebase --continue`
4. Then push

**Why this matters:**
- Ensures your PR is based on the latest main
- Avoids merge conflicts during PR review
- Makes PR review easier

---

#### If User Has Their Own Fork (Most Common)

When user wants to contribute patterns from their fork to upstream:

**Step 1: Ensure changes are committed and pushed to their fork**
```bash
cd ~/Code/community-patterns
git status  # Verify all changes are committed
git push origin main
```

**Step 2: Update and rebase (see Step 0 above)**

**Step 3: Create pull request to upstream**
```bash
gh pr create \
  --repo jkomoros/community-patterns \
  --title "Add: pattern name" \
  --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Summary
- Brief description of the pattern
- Key features
- Use cases

## Testing
- [x] Pattern compiles without errors
- [x] Tested in browser at http://localhost:8000
- [x] All features working as expected

🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)
EOF
)"
```

#### If Working Directly on jkomoros/community-patterns

**CRITICAL: When working directly on the upstream repository, you MUST use branches and PRs. Direct pushes to main are NOT allowed.**

**Step 1: Create feature branch**
```bash
cd ~/Code/community-patterns
git checkout -b username/feature-name
```

**Step 2: Commit and push branch**
```bash
git add patterns/$GITHUB_USER/
git commit -m "Add: pattern name"
git push origin username/feature-name
```

**Step 3: Update and rebase (see Step 0 above)**

**Step 4: Create pull request**
```bash
gh pr create \
  --title "Add: pattern name" \
  --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Summary
- Brief description

## Testing
- [x] Tested and working

🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)
EOF
)"
```

**Step 5: Merge with rebase (when approved)**
```bash
gh pr merge PR_NUMBER --rebase --delete-branch
```

#### Important Notes

- **Always wait for user permission** before creating PRs
- **All PRs are merged with `--rebase`** (NOT `--squash` or `--merge`)
- This preserves individual commit history
- Commit frequently locally, but only create PR when user asks
- PRs will be reviewed before merging to upstream
- After merge, everyone gets your patterns automatically on next update

## Session Startup Checklist

Every session:

- [ ] **First**: Check if setup is complete (.claude-workspace exists?)
  - If NO → Run GETTING_STARTED.md
  - If YES → Continue below
- [ ] **Step 1**: Check and pull from upstream (this repo)
- [ ] **Step 1.5**: Check if labs/recipes need updates (weekly)
- [ ] **Step 2**: Load workspace configuration (.claude-workspace)
- [ ] **Step 3**: Check and start dev server if needed
- [ ] **Check**: Is Playwright MCP available for testing?
- [ ] **Ready**: Ask user what they want to work on

---

## When User Finishes Session

- [ ] Ensure all work is committed
- [ ] Ensure changes are pushed: `git push origin main`
- [ ] Remind: "Next session I'll check for upstream updates automatically"

---

## Remember

- **Auto-update is critical** - Gets latest instructions for you!
- **User's fork is their workspace** - Push freely to origin
- **Upstream is shared repo** - Pull from here for updates
- **Everyone in their own namespace** - No conflicts
- **Be helpful and encouraging** - Guide users through learning

---

## Special Cases

### User Asks to Modify Docs

If user wants to modify CLAUDE.md, GETTING_STARTED.md, etc.:
1. Confirm they understand this will diverge from upstream
2. Suggest creating issue/PR to upstream instead
3. If they insist, make changes but warn about merge conflicts on updates

### User Wants to Browse Other Patterns

```bash
# Show what's available
ls patterns/

# Show specific user's patterns
ls patterns/alice/

# Copy pattern to study
cp patterns/alice/shopping.tsx patterns/$GITHUB_USER/study-shopping.tsx
```

### User Encounters Merge Conflicts

Usually rare (everyone in their own namespace), but if it happens:
```bash
git status
# Show which files conflict

# If in their namespace - keep their version
# If in docs - review changes and merge carefully
```

---

Happy pattern development! 🚀
