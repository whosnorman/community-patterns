/**
 * Diff utilities for LLM extraction preview
 *
 * Provides word-level diff computation and rendering for showing
 * changes before applying extracted data.
 *
 * ## Usage
 *
 * These utilities are used in person.tsx and food-recipe.tsx to show
 * field-by-field diffs when extracting data from unstructured notes.
 *
 * Example pattern:
 * ```typescript
 * import { compareFields, computeWordDiff } from "./utils/diff-utils.ts";
 *
 * // 1. Derive changes from extraction result
 * const changesPreview = derive({ extractionResult, ...currentFields }, (data) => {
 *   return compareFields(data.extractionResult, {
 *     name: { current: data.currentName, label: "Name" },
 *     email: { current: data.currentEmail, label: "Email" }
 *   });
 * });
 *
 * // 2. Render in modal with word-level diffs
 * {changesPreview.map(change => (
 *   <div>
 *     <strong>{change.field}</strong>
 *     {computeWordDiff(change.from, change.to).map(part => {
 *       if (part.type === "removed") {
 *         return <span style={{color: "red", textDecoration: "line-through"}}>{part.word}</span>;
 *       }
 *       if (part.type === "added") {
 *         return <span style={{color: "green"}}>{part.word}</span>;
 *       }
 *       return <span>{part.word}</span>;
 *     })}
 *   </div>
 * ))}
 * ```
 *
 * ## Future Improvements
 *
 * ### Option A: Pattern-Based Modal Component (Higher Abstraction)
 *
 * Could create `lib/diff-preview-modal.tsx` as a reusable pattern:
 * - Takes: changes array, onApply handler stream, onCancel handler stream
 * - Returns: Complete modal UI with all styling
 * - Pros: Maximum code reuse (~60-70 lines), guaranteed consistency
 * - Cons: Less flexible, harder to customize, handler complexity
 * - Trade-off: Worth it if you have 5+ patterns using extraction
 *
 * ### Option B: Micro-Recipe for Diff Rendering (Medium Abstraction)
 *
 * Could create `lib/diff-text.tsx` as a tiny recipe just for rendering:
 * - Takes: from/to strings
 * - Returns: Styled diff JSX
 * - Pros: Reusable rendering logic (~20 lines saved)
 * - Cons: Recipe overhead for simple task, mixing utilities with patterns
 * - Trade-off: Current inline approach is clearer
 *
 * ### Option C: Current Approach (Utilities Only) ✅ RECOMMENDED
 *
 * Keep current utilities-only approach:
 * - Utilities: Pure functions (computeWordDiff, compareFields)
 * - Patterns: Inline JSX for rendering
 * - Pros: Simple, clear, flexible, no indirection
 * - Cons: ~60 lines of JSX per pattern
 * - Trade-off: 60 lines of straightforward JSX is acceptable cost
 *
 * **Recommendation**: Current approach is correct. The utilities capture the
 * complex logic (diff algorithm, field comparison). The rendering JSX is
 * simple enough that indirection would add more complexity than value.
 *
 * **When to reconsider**: If you have 5+ patterns with identical extraction
 * modals, Option A (pattern-based) becomes worth the abstraction cost.
