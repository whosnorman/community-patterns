Class Descriptions
Registration and Payment
 All students at TBS may register for Enrichment classes. Additionally, 
Students from other schools may register for Enrichment classes if they are signed up for The Depot. 
Tinker Coop programs are open to the entire community whether or not they are TBS or The Depot students. 
Enrichment classes are taught by external providers and incur fees in addition to The Depot/ExDay fees. 
Complete one form for each student by Friday, January 9th. Timely registration is important for instructors who need to know if they have enough enrollment and materials, and for overall program administration.
Class registration is on a first-come, first-served basis: students who register after the max has been reached will be added to a waitlist. For the competitive FIRST Robotics teams, a form does not guarantee enrollment, and a selection process may be involved. 
TBS will notify parenting adults whose emails were included during registration if maximum capacity has been reached and/or if enrollment is insufficient to meet the minimum level needed.
Registration closes after the first class meeting and there are no refunds after the second class meeting.
TBS students who are not enrolled in ExDay and participate in Enrichment classes that start more than 15 minutes after their school day ends, or need ExDay supervision between Enrichment classes for more than 15 minutes will be charged a reduced ExDay rate for the Fall session as follows: $130/session Mondays/Fridays, $150/session Tuesdays/Wednesdays, $140/session Thursdays. 
Parenting adults will be billed through Smart Tuition. Please note that any payments for Tinker  Coop programs will be processed separately and will not be billed through, nor appear on your Smart Tuition statement.

Frequently Asked Questions

“Did I sign up for full-time Extended Day?  Can I sign up for it if I haven’t?” 
Sign in to your Finalsite account (https://theberkeleyschool.fsenrollment.com/users/sign_in).
After logging in, click on "View Checklist" in blue letters to the right of your child's name under that status bar. 
If you would like to register for full-time ExDay, the UAC Extended Day Program Registration (2025-26) form will appear towards the bottom of the page, under "Optional Steps" and you will want to "Complete Form."
If you have questions, please email datasupport@theberkeleyschool.org.


“Can my student sign up for multiple classes in one afternoon?” 
Yes, if the timing works out or if the overlap is short.

What if my student wants to take the class but isn’t in the right age range? 
If your student is not in the given age range but is still interested, please reach out to Helia and Chris. If there is space in the class, we will check with the instructor about exceptions.

Why are Tinker Coop payments separate? 

		Tinker Coop operates as an independent nonprofit, though closely partnered 
		with The Berkeley School, supported by TBS’s educational philosophy 
centers on civic engagement and community partnership. Because we’re separate organizations, all registration, payments, and program administration are managed through Tinker Coop—separate from TBS’s billing system.

“I have a great idea/connection/wish for an enrichment class! What do I do?” 
Let us know!  We are always looking for ways to expand our ExDay Enrichment offerings.

Class Descriptions

Carpentry, Gr. K-3, 3-8 Kids’ Carpentry is designed to teach kids the safe use of hand tools and general woodworking skills. Through a sequence of steps young carpenters gain the skill and competence to complete increasingly more complicated projects. From boats to bird feeders, doll furniture, clocks, games, airplanes, and many more, the kids have a wide range of projects to choose from, after first completing their sanding block and super-top. In addition to the fun, kids also gain quality experiences in measuring, applied math (including fractions), problem-solving, craftsmanship, and they are empowered by the hands-on experiences.

Chess, Gr. TK-8 The Chess Enrichment Program introduces students to the strategic world of chess in an engaging, developmentally appropriate way. It supports cognitive development, patience, problem-solving, and sportsmanship, while making learning fun through stories, challenges, and game-based learning. The program is ideal for students of all experience levels and encourages critical thinking, focus, and decision-making skills. TK students may require a parenting adult to support in class if needed.

CodeFu, Gr. K-5, 3-6 The Art of CodeFu is back and better than ever! From cyber security to video games to websites, our students learn the various projects that will give them invaluable coding/tech skills for their future. CodeFu: Mini Coding Dojo Using iPad/Asus tablet applications like Scratch Jr, Kodable, Light bot, and Bloxels coupled with hands-on board games that promote social problem-solving. CodeFu's Dojo teaches students the computational logic of Computer Science/coding as well as providing them with an introduction into a number of block-based coding languages.

Founded in 2015 in the San Francisco Bay Area, the Art of CodeFu was created with a unique combination of teachers with decades of experience in the classroom and top programmers in Silicon Valley integrating coding into subjects from PE to science. Our programs take coding to the next level by teaching our students about the yin & yang of technology & nature—the importance of technology, but also its role in the balance with being active and in tune with the outside world.

Cooking, Gr. TK-3,  3-6 Ready, set, cook! This culinary adventure invites students to roll up their sleeves and dive into the delicious world of "Cooking With Friends." With a sprinkle of teamwork and a dash of fun, children will explore delightful sweet and savory recipes that nourish both body and mind. They'll develop essential kitchen skills like measuring, mixing, and knife safety, all while laughing and learning alongside their new friends. This series is a great way to boost confidence as kids follow directions and discover the joys of preparing healthy and delicious meals together! TK students may require a parenting adult to support in class if needed.

Dungeons & Dragons, Gr. 3-6, 4-8 D&D is a creative game of fantasy and high adventure that strengthens the imagination and collaborative skills of its players. Players take on the role of a fantastical character of their own devising and create sprawling adventures under the guidance of a dungeon master. Our dungeon masters bring years of professional theater training and experience into their games, calling on their creative backgrounds to create immersive environments that are fertile ground for imaginative play. We provide all materials required for play and welcome players of all experience levels. At the end of each session our dungeon masters will provide a written summary of the day’s journey so you can experience the adventure as it unfolds from week to week. Despite some stigma, Dungeons and Dragons isn’t an anti-social activity as it has been depicted in the past; it has evolved into an impactful method to promote socialization, critical thinking, and collaborative play that we believe all kids could benefit from.

See tinyurl.com/TinkerSpring2026 for details 

The FIRST Tech Challenge off-season is an ideal time for students in grades 6-8 to engage in STEM, teamwork, and innovation while preparing for next fall’s competition season and contributing to the sustainability of our team. In the spring, we focus on building foundational skills, mentoring new participants, and exploring robotics design, programming, and participating in outreach events. FIRST is about more than just robots—it’s about fostering collaboration, creativity, and problem-solving. With roles ranging from hardware and programming to fundraising, outreach, and media, there’s a place for all motivated students, including those new to engineering skills. Though the spring session is non-competitive, teamwork and commitment during weekly meetings remain essential for participation.

The  FIRST Lego League non-competitive, spring season is a fantastic time for students in grades 4-8 to explore robotics, teamwork, and the engineering design process in a low-pressure, high-curiosity environment. While the fall program focuses on official competition, the spring session offers a more relaxed space to build foundational skills and try out different aspects of FLL Challenge.

Using the LEGO Spike Prime system, students will work on robot design, programming, and problem-solving as they complete themed challenges (this year’s is archaeology!).

No experience is needed—just a willingness to collaborate, try new things, and have fun. In FLL, we value teamwork and creative thinking just as much as technical skill. The spring is also a great way for curious students to get a feel for what the fall season might look like.


FIRST Lego League Explore (non-competitive), grades 1-3, K with permission is offered through TBS’s partnership with Tinker Coop. In addition to the TBS interest form, Mytko asks that you also complete this form: Tinker Coop 🐔Spring 2026 interest form.

“Improv is the art of making the ordinary extraordinary” Improv Club will focus on short form improvisational comedy, which involves games and short scenes inspired by audience suggestions.  We will focus on and develop skills in listening, teamwork, confidence, creativity, and spontaneity. During each session, students will work in small, independent groups or as one big group to explore improv games and exercises. Experienced improvisers often lead through example, and may have more “stage time.”  All students are expected to be active, respectful listeners when they are participating as the audience for their peers.  No previous experience is necessary. 

Judo, Gr. TK-3 and 3-8 In Griffin Performance Judo, students will learn rolls, how to fall safely, basic throws, practice Ne-waza (ground work) and other techniques in a fun and safe environment. Students will learn the Japanese terms of Judo: Maximum Efficiency, Minimum Effort 精力善用; Mutual Welfare and Benefit 自他共栄, and Softness Controls Hardness 柔能く剛を制す - 柔能剛制. Judo teaches discipline and resilience that will help them throughout life. Each class begins with a short game.

Judo was founded by Jigoro Kano, who as an educator sought to elevate the traditional art of JuJutsu from being a martial art to being a martial way which became Judo. To this day, Judo can be applied far beyond just its physical practice. Griffin Performance Judo was founded in 2019 by Adham Ramadan and Bill Fairchild. With the help of Cody Costello, GPJ taught at various locations throughout the East Bay, from El Cerrito, to Temescal, West Oakland to San Leandro. Preschools all the way up to high schools, our instructors have taught everywhere. During the pandemic we even held online and outdoor, contactless classes.

Instructor Adham Ramadan is a 3rd degree black belt and has nearly 20 years of judo experience and several years of teaching classes for school programs. Adham is an expert at working with beginners in judo. Instructor Cody Three Bears Costello is a 2nd degree black belt. He’s been teaching judo since 2012 and has taught at 15+ schools in all age ranges.
