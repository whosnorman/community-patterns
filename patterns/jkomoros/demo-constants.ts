This is Maya Rodriguez's go-to comfort food recipe. A decadent blend of four cheeses creates the ultimate creamy mac and cheese with a crispy breadcrumb topping.

Ingredients:
- 1 lb fusilli pasta
- 4 tbsp butter
- 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
- 4 cups whole milk
- 2 cups sharp cheddar cheese, shredded
- 1 cup gruyere cheese, shredded
- 1 cup fontina cheese, shredded
- 1/2 cup parmesan cheese, grated
- 1/2 cup breadcrumbs

1. Cook fusilli pasta according to package directions until al dente. Drain and set aside.
2. Preheat oven to 375°F.
3. In large pot, melt butter over medium heat. Whisk in flour and cook for 2 minutes.
4. Gradually add milk, whisking constantly until smooth and thickened, about 5 minutes.
5. Reduce heat to low. Stir in cheddar, gruyere, fontina, and half the parmesan until melted and smooth.
6. Season sauce with salt and pepper. Add cooked pasta and stir to coat.
7. Transfer to greased 9x13 baking dish.
