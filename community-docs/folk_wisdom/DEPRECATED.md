# DEPRECATED

This directory is **deprecated**.

## What Happened

Previously, we had a three-tier system:
1. `superstitions/` - single observations
2. `folk_wisdom/` - multiple confirmations
3. `blessed/` - framework author approved

## New Model

Verified knowledge should be **upstreamed directly to labs docs** (`~/Code/labs/docs/common/`) rather than maintained here.

Community-patterns now only holds unverified superstitions in `superstitions/`.

## What To Do With This Content

If you find useful content here that isn't in labs docs:
1. Identify the appropriate doc in `~/Code/labs/docs/common/`
2. Add the information to that doc
3. Create a PR to labs
4. Once merged, this content can be deleted

## Files Here

The files in this directory may contain useful information that hasn't been upstreamed yet. Treat them as candidates for upstreaming, not as authoritative documentation.
