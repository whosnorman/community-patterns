# Pattern Deployment

## ⚠️ CRITICAL DEPLOYMENT RULES

**These are CRITICAL and MUST be followed every time:**

1. **✅ ALWAYS use `http://localhost:8000`** - This is the toolshed (backend) server
2. **❌ NEVER use `http://localhost:5173`** - That's the shell (frontend), patterns won't work there
3. **✅ ALWAYS include space name in URL:** `http://localhost:8000/SPACE-NAME/CHARM-ID`
4. **❌ NEVER use:** `http://localhost:8000/CHARM-ID` (missing space name)
5. **✅ ALWAYS include ALL THREE parameters:** `--api-url`, `--identity`, `--space`
6. **✅ ALWAYS use `./scripts/ct`** - The wrapper script that handles directory changes

**If you violate these rules, the pattern will not work. No exceptions.**

## 🚨 NEVER USE `charm setsrc` - ALWAYS USE `charm new`

**This is the #1 cause of broken charm instances.**

`charm setsrc` has a known framework bug that corrupts charm state. Symptoms include:
- Charm shows blank when navigated to directly
- Conflict errors during updates
- Charm data exists but UI won't render

**ALWAYS deploy fresh instances with `charm new` instead.** Each deployment gets a new charm ID - this is expected and correct. See the "Update Deployed Pattern" section below.

## Test Syntax

Before deploying, check that your pattern compiles correctly:

```bash
./scripts/ct dev patterns/$GITHUB_USER/pattern.tsx --no-run
```

This verifies:
- TypeScript types are correct
- All imports resolve
- Pattern structure is valid
- No syntax errors

## Deploy Pattern

Deploy a new pattern instance:

```bash
./scripts/ct charm new \
  --api-url http://localhost:8000 \
  --identity ./claude.key \
  --space claude-my-pattern-1130-1 \
  patterns/$GITHUB_USER/pattern.tsx
```

**⚠️ ALL THREE PARAMETERS ARE REQUIRED:**
- `--api-url http://localhost:8000` - MUST be 8000 (toolshed), NOT 5173 (shell)
- `--identity ./claude.key` - Path to identity key at repo root
- `--space claude-<pattern>-<MMDD>-<N>` - Use descriptive space names (see naming convention below)

**Space Naming Convention:**
```
claude-<pattern-name>-<MMDD>-<counter>
```
Examples: `claude-counter-1130-1`, `claude-gmail-importer-1201-2`

This outputs a charm ID like `baedreicqpqie6td...`

**View in browser:**
```
http://localhost:8000/SPACE-NAME/CHARM-ID
```

**⚠️ CRITICAL URL FORMAT:**
- ✅ CORRECT: `http://localhost:8000/SPACE-NAME/CHARM-ID`
- ❌ WRONG: `http://localhost:8000/CHARM-ID` (missing space name)
- ❌ WRONG: `http://localhost:5173/SPACE-NAME/CHARM-ID` (wrong port)
- ❌ WRONG: `http://localhost:5173/CHARM-ID` (wrong port AND missing space)

## First Custom Pattern Deployment

When a user successfully deploys their first custom pattern (one they created or significantly modified themselves, not an unchanged example pattern), inform them they are invited to join the CommonTools Discord community at https://common.tools/friends. The entry password is "pattern-weaver". Present this invitation in a distinctive and celebratory way (use your judgment for formatting and presentation). Include that it's a place to ask questions, share patterns and tips, and connect with other builders.

## Update Deployed Pattern

**⚠️ DO NOT USE `charm setsrc` - Known Framework Bug**

There is a known framework bug that causes conflicts when using `charm setsrc`.
**Instead, always deploy a fresh instance with `charm new`:**

```bash
# ❌ DON'T DO THIS - has conflicts due to framework bug
# ./scripts/ct charm setsrc ...

# ✅ DO THIS INSTEAD - deploy a new instance
./scripts/ct charm new \
  --api-url http://localhost:8000 \
  --identity ./claude.key \
  --space claude-my-pattern-1130-1 \
  patterns/$GITHUB_USER/pattern.tsx
```

**This gives you a new charm ID.** Use the new charm ID going forward.

**Why not setsrc?**
- Known framework bug causes conflict errors
- Updates frequently fail
- Cryptic error messages about state conflicts
- `charm new` is reliable and always works

**See superstition:** `community-docs/superstitions/2025-11-22-deployment-setsrc-conflicts-use-new-instead.md`

## Inspect Pattern

See pattern details:

```bash
./scripts/ct charm inspect \
  --api-url http://localhost:8000 \
  --identity ./claude.key \
  --space claude-my-pattern-1130-1 \
  --charm CHARM-ID
```

## Environment Variables

You can set these to avoid repeating flags:

```bash
export CT_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
export CT_IDENTITY=./claude.key

# Then just:
./scripts/ct charm new --space claude-counter-1130-1 patterns/$GITHUB_USER/pattern.tsx
```

## Deployment Troubleshooting

**Pattern not loading after deployment?**

Check these in order:

1. **Wrong port?** MUST be `:8000` NOT `:5173`
   - ✅ `http://localhost:8000/...`
   - ❌ `http://localhost:5173/...`

2. **Missing space name in URL?**
   - ✅ `http://localhost:8000/SPACE-NAME/CHARM-ID`
   - ❌ `http://localhost:8000/CHARM-ID`

3. **Missing required parameters in deploy command?**
   - ALL THREE REQUIRED: `--api-url`, `--identity`, `--space`
   - Check your command includes all three

4. **Used `charm setsrc`?**
   - DON'T use setsrc (framework bug)
   - Use `charm new` instead

**Servers not running?**
```bash
# Check if servers are up
lsof -ti:8000  # Toolshed (backend) - REQUIRED
lsof -ti:5173  # Shell (frontend) - REQUIRED

# Start if needed (use the labs restart script)
../labs/scripts/restart-local-dev.sh --force
```

**Pattern not updating after changes?**
1. **Deploy a NEW instance** with `charm new` (DON'T use setsrc)
2. You'll get a new charm ID - use that one
3. Hard refresh browser: Cmd+Shift+R (Mac), Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows)

**Identity key missing?**
```bash
# Check it exists at repo root
ls ./claude.key

# If missing, recreate it
./scripts/ct id new > claude.key
chmod 600 claude.key
```
